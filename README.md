## Team Member Contributions
- Individually, Barr contributed to the MoviesServlet, SingleMovieServlet, and the Single Movie page on the frontend, as well as the code to set up the index.html homepage without displaying the genres and stars
- Individually, Mingjia did the initial setup on AWS and the GitHub repo, refactored much of Barr's code to work properly with Maven and Tomcat, wrote the SQL queries for the genres and stars on the "All Movies" page and the nested query to select all the movies at once. Mingjia also filmed the demo video and prepared the final submission.
- Collaboratively, Barr and Mingjia wrote and debugged code in all of the servlets, troubleshooted errors in JDBC, Tomcat, and Maven, wrote code to display genres and stars in index.html, and created the hyperlinks connecting all of the pages together.
